## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r StudentScore}

studentScoreDF <- data.frame(
      "Student" = 1:10,
      "Pre-test" = c(55,54,47,57,51,61,57,54,63,58),
      "Post-test" = c(61,60,56,63,56,63,59,56,62,61))

studentScoreDF
```
```{r statistics}
library(Hmisc)
StudentDFSummary <- Hmisc::summary(studentScoreDF$`Pre-test`)
StudentDFSummary
```
